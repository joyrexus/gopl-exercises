## 1.7

The function call `io.Copy(dst, src)` reads from `src` and writes to `dst`. Use it instead of `ioutil.ReadAll` to copy the response body to `os.Stdout` without requiring a buffer large enough to hold the entire stream. Be sure to check the error result of `io.Copy`.


## 1.8

Modify fetch to add the prefix `http://` to each argument URL if it is missing. You might want to use `strings.HasPrefix`.


## 1.9

Modify `fetch` to also print the HTTP status code, found in `resp.Status`.
